### Dynamic Memory Allocator

A dynamic memory allocator implemented using an explicit segregated free-list. 

Lab taken from **CS:APP**.

Future improvements:
- Reduce number of free-list operations in coalesce and other functions?
- Deferred coalescing?
- Remove footers from allocated blocks
- Fine tune segregated list
